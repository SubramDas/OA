You are given a tree of n nodes and n-1 edges. Additionally, you are
also given an array C of length n, where C[i] (1 ≤ i ≤ n) denotes the
value of node i.

Task

Calculate the sum of medians of every simple path of odd length
starting from node 1. (You should add median of node values, that is
C[i])





Solution:

Keep a set and take out median from that
traverse and put values of vertices when going to that node.
If the set is odd size take out the median
