This newspaper, HackerRank News, distributed lottery tickets to everyone, and the winning lottery ID is described in the paper denoted by winnerID.

In order to win the lottery, a customer having a lottery ID denoted by lotteryID needs to maximize the length of the longest common subsequence of the strings lotteryID and winnerID. To do so, the customer can perform up to k operations. In each operation, the customer can change any character in lotteryID either to its next or previous character.

Find the maximum possible length of the longest common subsequence after at most k such operations.

n = 100, k = 100

SOLUTION:

DP solution should work, n*n*k
