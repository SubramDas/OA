You are given a matrix X of size N*M. You need to go from point (1, 1) to (N, M). From a point (i, j), you can either jump to (i+X, j) or (i, j+X+1). You cannot jump outside the matrix.

Find the minimum number of moves needed to reach the point (N, M) from (1, 1). If it is not possible to do so, print -1.

Solution:
