Given an array of size N containing integers, find the minimum possible sum that can be formed by adding the elements in the array. You can perform the following operation at most once:

Select an index. If the sum of all the elements in the array up to the selected index is a multiple of the element present in the index, divide the sum up to the selected index by the element present in the index.

After dividing, you do not have to add this element to the resultant sum.

After this operation is performed, you will have to add the rest of the elements in the array to the resultant sum formed after the operation.

Return the minimum possible result that can be formed after the operations.
