An aspiring programmer is gearing up for the upcoming Women's Cup coding competition. During the practice, the programmer comes across a question where the contestant is required to find the minimum number of operations required to make all the integers of a given array equal.

In a single operation, one can flip any bit of any element of the array. Considering the given array, arr = [1, 2, 3], in one operation, either 1 can be made equal to 0, 3, 5, 9, etc., 2 can be made 0, 3, 6, 10, etc., or 3 can be made into 2, 1, 7, etc.

Find the minimum operations required, which will help the programmer verify the answer.


SOLUTION:

Keep a frequency array to track the set bits for every number in the array
check if the set bits are higher or the unset bits for each 31 bits sum up the min bits
