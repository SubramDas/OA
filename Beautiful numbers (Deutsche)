You call a number beautiful if it contains at least 1 bit '0' and at most 3 bits '0' in its binary representation.
For example. 5 (101)â‚‚ and 8 (1000), are beautiful numbers but numbers like 15 (1111)2 and 16
(10000)2 are not. Strings in parentheses are the corresponding binary representations.

You are given Q queries of the type L, R. consider all beautiful numbers between the range Land R
(inclusive)

Find the sum of cubes of all such beautiful numbers. Since the sum can be very large, output it modula
998244353


Solution:
take the max number in the query i.e R
loop from 0th bit to the last bit where R is set (say x)

take mask = 1111 upto x;

now 3 loops ( 0 to x-1, ...)
at each position unset the bit and count the number of unset bits
if number is inside the range L to R we can sum it in cubes
